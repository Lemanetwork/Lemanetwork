👋 Hello, my name is Luis, I am a trilingual (Spanish - English - French) System Engineer/Full Stack Developer with over 14 years of experience managing technology projects and developing innovative solutions.

🖥 I am skilled at giving specialized support to IT infrastructures and a variety of devices on different platforms like Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

🐱‍🏍 One of my passions is helping others, and for that reason, I can happily share that I served as a volunteer for 4 years in Africa, which means I have around 5 years of experience working and volunteering in humanitarian projects and education.

👨‍💻 Currently, I am studying Python, preparing myself for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, and working very hard to master my skills as a Full Stack Developer:
